# bigger_kotlin_rpg
(Almost) a complete rewrite of TRPGIII in Kotlin. Some functions such as saving and consumable items were removed because items seemed useless and I did not want to write another save function.

Has not been fully bug tested so there are probably errors that occur in long runs that I have not encountered yet.
